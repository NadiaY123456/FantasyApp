9:52 / 12-23: Implement below. I am shooting for production-grade pipeline. Also do it in a modular /refactored way when possible. If you need to see additional files to make a more robust decision, plmk which files are those.

Make sure to provide EXACT EDITS, not like "wherever you compute ...". If you don't see the file you need, EXPLICITELY ask for it upfront!

Task:
As of now, my camera centers somewhere in the character chest. So when caracter stands idle but moves his body, the ground / terrain moves as well and it looks weird. So I want when Flash - main character that I control with controls - is idle, the terrain should be stationary on the screen.
