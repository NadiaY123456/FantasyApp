9:52 / 12-23: Implement below. I am shooting for production-grade pipeline. Also do it in a modular /refactored way when possible. If you need to see additional files to make a more robust decision, plmk which files are those.

Make sure to provide EXACT EDITS, not like "wherever you compute ...". If you don't see the file you need, EXPLICITELY ask for it upfront!

Task:
i want to add UI overlay which will print which animation is playing, if animation is modified and if so - which modification is applied, or if the transition between animations are playing.
also, because some transitions are super brief, i want to have history printed as well.  


about my codebase:
The transition/connection logic and the on‑the‑fly walk shaping are both in AnimLibS; here are the exact spots.

Transition/connection between animations (with dynamic tweaking)

0-IdleSequence.swift (line 347) builds/splices transition sequences (idle↔idle, idle→walk) and then blends into the target walk style.
3-build-transition.swift (line 9) constructs the transition clip and injects MatchTransformAlteration per element (this is where the transition animation is modified on the fly to align start/end poses).
2-ExtendWalkSequence.swift (line 263) blends from one walk style to another.
2-ExtendWalkSequence.swift (line 436) attaches a per‑element blend tree (attachBlendInSequence) for the cross‑fade.
3-blend-elments-in-tree.swift (line 9) actually applies that blend tree to the transforms.
Walk direction/shape modifications (left/right/curved/stride)

0-WalkSequence.swift (line 109) chooses and splices a transitional turn clip based on orientation.
3-TranstionalSequence.swift (line 9) builds that turn sequence (picks left/right 180° candidates).
0-WalkSequence.swift (line 144) applies cir‑walk adjustment (turning the walk).
4-StepAlterations.swift (line 43) computes the per‑step cir adjustment and writes WalkCircleAlteration + deltaLocation/deltaRotation changes.
CirWalk.swift (line 9) computes additive offsets for cir‑walk (mirrors twist ops for right turns).
cirWalk-data.swift (line 9) applies those offsets to the actual transforms.
0-WalkSequence.swift (line 168) applies stride adjustment when path deviation is still high.
stride-data.swift (line 10) blends stride‑min/stride‑max data into the base animation.
